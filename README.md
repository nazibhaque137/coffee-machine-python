# ☕ Coffee Machine (Python Project)

A simple command-line coffee machine simulation written in Python.  
Built as part of a beginner project to practice loops, conditionals, functions, and resource management.

## Features
- Menu with Espresso, Latte, Cappuccino  
- Tracks available resources (water, milk, coffee beans)  
- Accepts coins (quarters, dimes, nickels, pennies)  
- Checks if resources are sufficient before making a drink  
- Processes payment, calculates change, and updates cash register  
- Prints a report of resources and money  
- Supports turning off the machine by typing `off`

## How to Run

### Locally
1. Clone this repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/<your-username>/coffee-machine-python.git
   cd coffee-machine-python
   ```
2. Run the program:
   ```bash
   python coffee_machine.py
   ```
   *(use `python3` if `python` points to Python 2)*

### GitHub Codespaces
1. Open the repo on GitHub.  
2. Click the green **Code** button → **Codespaces** → **Create codespace on main**.  
3. Once ready, open a terminal in Codespaces.  
4. Run:
   ```bash
   python coffee_machine.py
   ```
5. Interact with the machine via the terminal.

## Example Commands
- `espresso` → orders an espresso  
- `latte` → orders a latte  
- `cappuccino` → orders a cappuccino  
- `report` → prints resources and cash  
- `off` → turns off the machine  

## Learning Goal
- Practice while loops  
- Functions and parameters  
- Dictionaries and nested data  
- Handling user input  
- Simulating a real-world process in code
